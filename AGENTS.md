# Agent Directives: React Native Template TypeScript Plus

Welcome to the resurrection and modernization workspace for `react-native-template-ts-plus`.

## Key Objectives
- Modernize the React Native template from legacy RN `0.70.7` to current stable React Native `0.87.x`.
- Preserve the template's signature developer experience:
  - TypeScript-first `src/` app shell with `~/` alias imports
  - MobX-State-Tree root store with persistence
  - React Navigation structure with typed routes
  - React Native Paper theming (light/dark/system auto-toggle)
  - React Native BootSplash startup flow & asset generator
  - Safe-area & keyboard-avoiding container components
  - Deep linking out-of-the-box
  - Version bump automation & generated project README

## Operating Principles
1. **Scaffold-First Rebuild**: Base the native template on official `@react-native-community/cli` scaffolding for React Native `0.87.x`.
2. **Java 17 Requirement**: Android builds must use Java 17 via `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/zulu-17`.
3. **Template Placeholders**: Preserve `HelloWorld` placeholder name across all template files.
4. **Preserve Decision History**: All architectural and package migration choices must be recorded in `docs/adr/`.
5. **No Regressions**: Verify changes with lint, TypeScript compilation, Jest testing, and local smoke app initialization.
6. **Agent Harness & Verification**: Use `./tools/harness/dev.sh` (documented in `.agents/skills/react-native-harness/SKILL.md`) for atomic environment startup (`ensure`), teardown, semantic UI inspection (`ui`), and Maestro automation (`flow`). Never run persistent background servers inside agent sessions.

# Universal Empirical Agent Rules: PSL Harness Guidelines

These operational rules govern cognitive behavior and human-in-the-loop alignment for software engineering projects powered by the **PSL Harness**. All deterministic environment guarantees (runtime injection, pager normalization, surgical grep exit sanitization, output compaction) are enforced transparently by harness hooks.

## 1. Explicit Project Command Dictionary (The Victory Pattern)
*Explicit CLI palettes yield 10x lower human intervention rates:*

```bash
# 🧪 Project Verification & Native Toolchain
yarn version                                   # Execute version
yarn template:lint                             # Execute template:lint
yarn template:type-check                       # Execute template:type-check
yarn template:test                             # Execute template:test

# 🩺 Environment Diagnostics & Auto-Healing
agyis doctor                                   # Audit workstation runtimes & auto-heal
agyis status                                   # Print harness health, active hooks & telemetry

# 🧩 Skills & Subagents Discovery
agyis skills                                   # List installed modular skills & triggers
agyis agents                                   # List registered specialist subagents & tools

# 🌐 Remote Operations & Cloud/Mesh Triage (ADR-027)
agyis remote exec <target> "<cmd>"             # Multiplexed SSH with login-shell promotion
agyis remote script <target> <file>            # Stdin script streaming (zero disk footprint)
agyis remote triage <target>                   # Compact (<2KB) multi-component health report

# 📊 Empirical Telemetry Laboratory
agyis sync                                     # Audit & synchronize active session telemetry
```

## 2. Mandatory Project-Native Automated Verification Contract
1. **Mandatory Automated Verification**:
   - Never declare a task "complete", "fixed", or "verified" without executing the active project's native test runner (e.g. `pnpm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test`) and asserting exit code 0.
2. **Sub-Second to Fast Benchmark Invariant**:
   - Unit and integration tests must run as fast and hermetically as possible. Avoid slow network calls, unbounded sleeps, or unneeded whole-filesystem sweeps in verification loops.
3. **Hermetic Isolation**:
   - Tests must never access untracked external services without hermetic mocks or local temporary environments. All state-persisting operations should use temporary directories.

---

## 3. Terminal Invariants & Grep Probing Exception (ADR-013)
1. **Pre-flight Tool Availability (Mitigate Exit Code 127)**:
   - Verify tool availability (`command -v <bin>`) or handle fallback paths gracefully.
2. **Context Flood Prevention (The 200+ Step Cliff)**:
   - Never execute unfiltered commands that dump thousands of lines. Pipe large outputs through `head -n <N>`, `tail -n <N>`, or `wc -l`.
3. **Pattern Probing Exception**:
   - Error swallowing is banned in production code, but standalone terminal pattern probes (`grep`, `diff`) without conditionals must use `|| [ $? -eq 1 ]` to avoid panicking on benign empty matches.
4. **Multi-line Script Hygiene**:
   - Write multi-line scripts to temporary scratch files (`scratch/script.sh` or `scratch/script.py`) rather than escaping fragile multi-line bash `-c` one-liners.

---

## 4. Surgical Contiguous Edits Invariant (99.9% Tool Success)
*Audit revealed single contiguous block replacements achieve 99.9% tool success:*
1. Always make single contiguous block replacements for targeted edits (`replace_file_content`).
2. Do NOT overwrite whole files when modifying specific functions, classes, or blocks.
3. Preserve surrounding comments, docstrings, imports, and formatting.

---

## 5. Context Preservation & Subagent Ladder
*Trajectories <50 steps / <50k tokens maintain 0.8 errors/session; >200 steps suffer a 20x error spike:*
1. **Keep Primary Context in the Healthy Zone (<50k tokens)**.
2. **Anti-Loop Heuristics**:
   - Do NOT repeatedly call `view_file` on the same file within consecutive steps.
   - Evolve search queries; do not repeat identical `grep_search` patterns.
   - Never poll task status in a loop (`manage_task(Action='status')`); await reactive wakeups.
3. **Subagent Delegation Protocol**:
   - Decompose multi-phase refactoring, test debugging, or massive build sweeps, delegating to specialist subagents (`@harness_builder`, `@harness_reviewer`, `@harness_auditor`, `@planner`, `@harness_custodian`, `@coordinator`) in isolated worktrees (`Workspace: "share"` or `"branch"`).
   - Follow the 6-stage Ladder lifecycle: Plan -> Implement (Executioner) -> Review (Hammer) -> Commit Gate (Custodian) -> Verification (Auditor) -> Archival (Coordinator).

## 6. The Artifact-First Planning Invariant (ADR-012) & Dynamic Aperture
1. **Anti-Chatbot Seduction**:
   - Never propose multi-component architectural changes or execution plans in raw conversational chat turns.
   - All non-trivial proposals must immediately crystallize into an interactive `implementation_plan.md` artifact before requesting operator confirmation.
2. **Dynamic Sliding Aperture**:
   - High resolution for current task execution.
   - Medium resolution for near-future milestones (macro boundaries; no speculative code).
   - Low resolution for far-future vision.
3. **Retroactive Horizon Compaction**:
   - When completing a phase or milestone, compact findings into the project ledger under 50 lines, update the project roadmap, commit clean code to git, and instruct the operator to reset session.

---

## 7. The 5 Ground Rules
1. **Rule 1 (Zero Error Swallowing)**: Never hide or swallow errors. Zero bare `except:`, no unhandled pipe errors (`set -euo pipefail`).
2. **Rule 2 (No Product Homework in Tests)**: Never redefine product logic or duplicate production calculations in test asserts.
3. **Rule 3 (Complete Deliveries)**: Deliver complete packages (code + types + tests + docs). No partial drafts or broken stubs.
4. **Rule 4 (Zero Verification Homework)**: Self-verify all changes using the project's native test runner before declaring completion.
5. **Rule 5 (Stop & Inquire)**: Stop and ask the operator if an unforeseen blocker, architectural conflict, or ambiguity arises.

---

## 8. Human-in-the-Loop & Steering Alignment
1. **Anti-Drift Commitment**: Anchor all implementation decisions to the agreed plan. If novel obstacles arise, pause and present options.
2. **Proactive Confirmation Gates**: When encountering destructive operations (file deletion, git branch force-push, node reboots), pause for explicit review.
3. **Clear Error Reporting**: If a command fails twice, stop thrashing. State the error concisely and propose a concrete path forward.
